## Inroduction
The CS Roadmap is a comprehensive guide designed for anyone looking to dive into the field of computer science. This roadmap covers all the essential topics needed to build a strong foundation and excel in the world of computing. The roadmap is structured to provide a step-by-step journey through the core areas of computer science, which include:
<ul>
                    <li><b>Introduction to Computer Science</b>: Lays the groundwork by introducing fundamental concepts and the importance of computing in today's world.</li>
                    <li><b>Programming Language + Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b>: Covers essential programming languages and introduces the principles of OOP to create efficient and maintainable code.</li>
                    <li><b>Problem Solving</b>: Focuses on developing the skills necessary to approach and solve complex computational problems systematically.</li>
                    <li><b>Data Structure: </b>Teaches various ways to organize and store data efficiently, which is critical for writing optimized programs.</li>
                    <li><b>Algorithms</b>: Introduces a variety of algorithms and techniques to solve problems efficiently, a key skill for any computer scientist.</li>
                    <li><b>Introduction to Operating Systems</b>: Explores the underlying software that manages computer hardware and provides an environment for applications to run.</li>
                    <li><b>Introduction to Database Systems:</b>Provides an understanding of how data is stored, managed, and retrieved, which is essential for handling information in any application.

</li>
</ul>

The CS Roadmap ensures a well-rounded understanding of computer science, from the basics to advanced topics, preparing learners to tackle real-world challenges in technology and beyond.

##### If you do not find an explanation of OOP in the course you have chosen, please review the rest of the sources.


### üí° Problem Solving

The content of Problem Solving, Data Structure and Algorithms will be linked together to get the best possible benefit.

To follow the tasks, you can join our group on codeforces [CS MEGA](https://codeforces.com/group/sfFl7whzkP/contests)

- [Why Problem Solving is important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipKtf75mTt8)
